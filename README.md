Project Objectives
	1.	Empower users to manage their dietary health
	•	Provide an easy-to-use interface for entering health data (blood sugar levels, blood pressure, weight, age, daily activity).
	2.	Personalize nutrition according to individual needs
	•	Develop a smart system that suggests healthy, balanced meals based on medical conditions and food preferences.
	3.	Track nutrients and calorie intake
	•	Offer an accurate tool for monitoring calories, fats, proteins, carbohydrates, sodium, and sugar.
	4.	Promote health awareness and sustainable habits
	•	Deliver daily tips and reminders to support healthier food choices.
